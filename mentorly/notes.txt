Mentorly Plugin

Installation Notes
===================
Upon activation, two pages are created:

- Mentor Signup - the page to show after a mentor has signed up
- Mentee Signup - the page to show after a mentee has signed up

Default email text is created for these emails:

1.	Email to Send to a Mentor Upon Signup
2.	Email to Send to a Mentee Upon Signup
3.	Email to Send to a Mentor to Remind them of the Mentor/Mentee Relationship
4.	Email to Send to both the Mentor and Mentee when a match is made
